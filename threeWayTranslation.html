<h1>Three-Way Translation</h1>

<div class="author">Author: <a href="http://thinkinghard.com">Philip Dorrell</a></div>

<p><a href="index.html">Correspondence</a> is a framework for interactively visualizing <i>correspondences</i> between
items in related structures.</p>

<p>When comparing <i>two</i> structures, granularity of corresponding items can be chosen based
on the relationships between the two structures.</p>

<p>With <i>three</i> (or more) structures, there is no clear best choice of granularity, because
for each structure, there are multiple relationships competing to determine the granularity.</p>

<p>A solution to this problem is to choose item numbers based on the finest granularity, and then
use <b>multiple IDs</b> for items that refer to multiple items in other structures.</p>

<p>The mouse-over interaction is then augmented to include <b>partial highlighting</b>. An item will be partially
highlighted whenever its IDs overlap with those of the selected item, but the partially hightlighted
item has at least one ID which is <i>not</i> an ID of the selected item.</p>

<p>Applying this to the concepts of "siblings" and "cousins", for items that have the same ID as a
selected item in the same structure or different structure respectively, this results in a total 
of six different types of highlighting:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The Selected Item</li>
 <li>A "sibling" in the same structure that shares all its IDs with the selected item</li>
 <li>A "partial sibling" in the same structure that shares some of its IDs with the selected item</li>
 <li>A "cousin" in a different structure that shares all its IDs with the selected item</li>
 <li>A "partial cousin" in a different structure that shares some of its IDs with the selected item</li>
 <li>An unrelated item that shares no IDs with the selected item.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, for example, if the selected item had IDs of <b>1,2,3</b>, then the following IDs 
for items in a different structure would give these matches:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>1</b>: "cousin"</li>
 <li><b>1,2</b>: "cousin"</li>
 <li><b>1,2,3</b>: "cousin"</li>
 <li><b>1,2,3,4</b>: "partial cousin"</li>
 <li><b>1,3,4</b>: "partial cousin"</li>
 <li><b>4</b>: "unrelated"</li>
</ul>


<p>Note: currently the colour schemes I have implemented do the same coloration for 
"sibling" and "cousin", so there are actually only four distinct colorations, i.e.
"selected", "match", "partial match" and "unrelated".</p>

<p>In the following example, partial matches are shown in the 
<span style="border: 1pt solid #80a080; background-color: #f8fff8;">very lightest green colour</span>.</p>

<div>
<div class="translations">
  <div class="structure">
    <span data-id="1">Item-one-beginning</span>
    <span data-id="2">Item-two</span>
    <span data-id="1">Item-one-end</span>
    <span data-id="3">Item-three</span>
  </div>
  <div class="structure">
    <span data-id="1">Uno</span>
    <span data-id="2">Dos</span>
    <span data-id="3">Tres</span>
  </div>
  <div class="structure">
    <span data-id="1,2">One-and-Two-Beginning</span>
    <span data-id="2">Two-end</span>
    <span data-id="3">Three</span>
  </div>
  <div class="structure">
    <span data-id="1">One</span>
    <span data-id="2,3">Two-and-Three</span>
  </div>
  <div class="structure">
    <span data-id="1,2,3">One-Two-and-Three</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Limitations of Three-Way (or more) Translation Visualization</h2>

<p>The primary use-case for <b>Correspondence</b> is to look at only two
structures at once, or, to look at more than two structures where all the structures
can be decomposed into items with the same or very much the same granularity.</p>

<p>Trying to make sense of matches and partial matches adds considerable 
cognitive load, something that Correspondence is designed to reduce in the first place.</p>

<p>The main use-case for three-way visualization is for translations between natural
language texts, where there is a high-quality "free" translation from the language being
taught to the learner's own native language, and one wishes to simultaneously display
the original text in the language being taught, a word-for-word translation created for display with 
Correspondence, and the original "free" translation, all at once. In this situation,
partial matches will occur, but only between the first and third or the second and third
versions &ndash; not between the first two, given that the second text is one that has
been carefully constructed so as not to require any partial matches with the original text.</p>
